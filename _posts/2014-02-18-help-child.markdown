The CereCare Wellness Centre for Children in Shanghai is a facility specializing in the care and education of children suffering from Cerebral Palsy. CP is a condition caused by a brain injury that occurs before or shortly after birth. Because physical development is impaired a child with Cerebral Palsy has trouble controlling the muscles of the body. Depending on what part of the brain is affected, a child might not be able to walk, talk, eat, or interact in the way most kids do. As a Xu Bo volunteer at the Centre, one can help take care of and play with the children, help with the children's personal development and hygiene education. Volunteers may also help the staff design the curriculum and/or help with the center's website by updating information and/or writing reports and articles for it. Volunteers with training in nursing or medicine may also be able to help with the children's treatment plans. This is a truly a worthwhile and rewarding project to take part in as a volunteer. Our work and travel program is available in the following countries and cities.
