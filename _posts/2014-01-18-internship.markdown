We are currently in the process of liaising with some of the leading international companies in Shanghai. We are hoping to be able to place students coming out of their university courses in applicable internship placements. The companies with whom we are setting up these internship at this stage are hotels, architecture and design companies, and Public Relations companies. However, once these relationships are established we will be extending the program to other kinds of companies and if volunteers have a particular interest we will contact appropriate companies as needed. Our internship program is available in the following countries and cities.
